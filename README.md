Building a Kubernetes cluster with Vagrant
===

This Vagrantfile allows building a Kubernetes cluster with a configurable number of workers. The cluster is configured using `kubeadm`.

This Vagrantfile requires the **vagrant-hostmanager** plugin.

If you are building behind proxies and require proxy configurations inside the VMs, install the **vagrant-proxyconf** plugin with `vagrant plugin install vagrant-proxyconf`.

The following files will be used by the Vagrantfile to override files inside the VM during startup, if found in a directory named **custom** at the same level as the Vagrantfile.

Files
---
* `custom/sources.list`: override default system apt sources
* `custom/sources.list.kubernetes`: override default kubernetes apt repo
* `custom/kube-flannel.yml`: override Flannel deployment manifest
* `custom/kube-flannel-rbac.yml`: override Flannel RBAC deployment manifest
* `kube.config`: local kubernetes config generated during kubeadm init (can be used like `kubectl --kubeconfig kube.config get pods`)

The following environment variables can be configured to control the disposition of the cluster:

Proxy variables
---
* `http_proxy`: configures `http_proxy` inside cluster VMs
* `https_proxy`: configures `https_proxy` inside cluster VMs
* `no_proxy`: configures `no_proxy` inside cluster VMs. If proxies are being configured, the master IP will be appended to `no_proxy` so that `kubeadm` functions as expected.
* `cacerts_dir`: if your SSL proxies perform MITM on SSL connections using custom root CA certificates, you may provide a path to a directory on the build host that contains additional CA certificates to add to the VMs. All certificates should end in `.crt` and each file should only contain one certificate.

Cluster sizing variables
---
* `worker_count`: configures the number of worker VMs that will be built (default **3**).
* `cpu_count`: configures the number of CPUs each VM will have (default **1**).
* `memory_mb`: configures the amount of memory in MB each VM will have (default **1024**).
* `drive_size`: configures the size of an additional volume the will be created in the VM (default **20480**).

Kubernetes variables
---
* `repo_prefix`: prefix used for container names within kube cluster
